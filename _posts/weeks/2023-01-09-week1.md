## Key Definitions

- **git repository**: A folder that tracks the history of edits to its files
- **Github repository**: A git repository online, like a Google Drive folder with history
- **Github pages**: A service that takes a Github repository and builds a
website from it (usually relying on conventions, like `index.md`)
- **Markdown**: A way to write plain text files with a little bit of formatting
- **commit**: A set of changes to a file or multiple files in a repository. A
repository history is made up of commits
- **git clone**: A git action to copy a repository from one place to another
(usually from somewhere like Github to our computer). Copies the contents of the
folder _and_ the entire history – the whole repository.
- **git commit**: A git action to take some changes we've made to files and
turn them into a commit in the repository's history
- **git push**: A git action to send commits from one place to another (usually
from our computer to Github)


## Lab Tasks

In this lab you'll make a professional website for yourself where you can post
your lab reports for the course. Please contact the instructor
(`jpolitz@eng.ucsd.edu`) if for personal privacy or security reasons you do not
want to publish a public web site, even under a pseudonym.

### Part 1 – Meet Your Group!

We've organized everyone into groups of 6-8 students for discussion. These
groups will be somewhat stable throughout the quarter, though some small changes
will likely happen. You will have a tutor or TA assigned to your group for help
and discussion.

Your discussion leader will share a Google Doc with your group where you can
fill in notes as you work; this document is only for your group. Your discussion
leader will _not_ take notes for you, you can have someone volunteer to take
notes or come up with a way to share the role.

**Write down in notes** In your groups, share, and note in the running notes
document (discussion leaders, you answer these as well!):

- How you'd like people to refer to you (pronounce your name/nickname, pronouns
like he/her/they, etc)
- Your major
- One of:
    - A UCSD student organization you're a member of or interested in
    - Your favorite place you've found on campus so far
    - A useful campus shortcut or trick you know

### Part 2 – Your CSE15L Account

Look up your course-specific account for CSE15L here:

[https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

For help on resetting your password here is a tutorial.  
[[TUTORIAL] How to Reset your Password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit)

Follow the onscreen instructions very carefully! Have someone watch you do it if
you feel like it isn't working.

If you've reset and you're waiting a few minutes for it to take effect, feel
free to start working on later sections of the lab, 

### Part 3 – Visual Studio Code

Go to the Visual Studio Code website
[https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and follow the
instructions to download and install it on your computer. There are versions for
all the major operating systems, like OSX (for Macs) and Windows (for PCs). If
you only have access to a tablet or Chromebook while remote, you won't be able
to install it right now.  If you don't, you should chat your lab leader and let
them know, and for any pair activities this week and next we will make sure to
pair you with someone who does.

If you run into an error installing Visual Studio Code, speak up! You can
screenshare and ask for help, and the tutor or someone in your group might be
able to answer for you!

When it is installed, you should be able to open a window that looks like this
(it might have different colors, or a different menu bar, depending on your
system and settings):

![/images/vscode.png](/images/vscode.png)

**Write down in notes**: Everyone should share a screenshot of VScode open –
help folks figure it out if it won't install. If someone gets stuck, take a
screenshot of the error message or point at which they are stuck so we can help
them figure it out later, and they can decide to keep trying (potentially with
the tutor helping) or move on.

### Part 4 – Remotely Connecting

**In Your Group for 15 minutes**

**Note** In this section, whenever you see a chunk of code in light gray, we are specifying that the code block is running on the **remote** server. For example:
```
  $ this is a command to the remote server
```
{: .remote}

```
  $ this is a command on your own computer
```

Many courses in CSE use course-specific accounts. These are similar to accounts
you might get on other systems at other institutions (or a future job). We'll
see how to use VScode/terminal to connect to a remote computer over the Internet
to do work there.

There is a first step you need if you're on Windows: install a program called
OpenSSH, which is a program that can connect your computer to other computers
that have this kind of account. You should only install the OpenSSH **client**,
not the server:

[Install OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)


Then, in Visual Studio Code, we are going to connect to the remote computer
using VSCode's remote option.  For reference, we're following the steps in
[“Connect to a remote
host”](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host)
step.

For the first step, open a terminal in VSCode (Ctrl or Command + \`, or use the
Terminal → New Terminal menu option).  Your command will look like this, but
with the `zz` replaced by the letters in your course-specific account.

```
$ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```

(That's one, five, l (not one); the one and l look very close in some fonts.)

Since this is likely the first time you've connected to this server, you will
probably get a message like this:

```
⤇ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```

I (Joe) always say yes to these messages when I'm connecting to a new server for
the first time; it's expected to get this message in that case. If you get this
message when you're connecting to a server you connect to _often_, it could mean
someone is trying to listen in on or control the connection. This answer is a
decent description of what's going on: [Ben Voigt's
answer](https://superuser.com/questions/421074/ssh-the-authenticity-of-host-host-cant-be-established/421084#421084)

So type `yes` and press enter, then give your password; the whole interaction
should look something like this once you give your password and are logged in:

```
# On your client
⤇ ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6-202.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
Password: 
```

```
# Now on remote server

{: .remote}

Now your terminal is connected to a computer in the CSE basement, and any
commands you run will run on that computer! We call your computer the _client_
and the computer in the basement the _server_ based on how you are connected.

If, in this process, you run into errors and can't figure out how to proceed,
ask! When you ask, take a screenshot of your problem and add it to your group's
running notes document, then describe what the fix was. If you don't know how to
take a screenshot, ask!

Remember – it is **rare** for a tutorial to work perfectly. We often have to
stop, think, guess, Google search, ask someone, etc. in order to get things to
work the way the tutorial says. I look up the right way to describe the
`(yes/no)` answer on first login all the time, for example. So you are helping
your group _learn about potential issues_ when you do this, and that's a major
learning outcome of the course! If you see someone else have an issue that you
didn't, ask why, and what might be different about what you did, or how your
environment is set up. You will learn by reflecting on this.

**Write down in notes** When you're done, **discuss** what you saw upon login.
Take a screenshot or copy/paste the output. Did you all see the same thing? What
might the differences mean? Note the results of your discussion in the notes
document.

### Part 5 – Run Some Commands  

Try running the commands `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`, `mkdir`, and `cp` a few times in
different ways, both on **your computer**, and on the **remote computer** after
ssh-ing.  Discuss in your group what you see. Can you cause them to produce
error messages? What do they mean? If you're on Windows, what happens when you
use them on Windows?

Here are some specific useful commands to try:

- `cd ~`
- `cd`
- `ls -lat`
- `ls -a`
- `ls <directory>` where `<directory>` is
`/home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/cs15lfa22abc`, where the `abc` is one of the other
group members' username
- `cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt ~/`
- `cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt`

**Write down in notes**: Copy at least one example from each group member, with
an explanation, into your shared notes doc.

Hint: To log out of the remote server in your terminal, you can use:

- Ctrl-D
- Run the command `exit`

You can also open more terminals in VSCode (there is a little + button at the
top of the terminal window where you can create another).

### Part 6 – git, Github, and Github Pages

Having a professional portfolio website for yourself can be useful in many, many
ways. It's a useful URL to put at the top of your resume/CV where potential
employers can learn more about you.  Lots of great work in CS is published only on
someone's personal page, or is at least most accessible there.  Most CS faculty
have such a page ([just](https://roseyu.com/) [a
few](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/) [examples](http://kvaccaro.com/) [from
new](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~jensenca/OSU_ENGR/index.html) CSE
faculty), for example.

Also, journaling and logging what you've learned is a powerful tool. Writing
down what we've done and how we've done it, for an audience (real or imagined)
other than ourselves, forces us to confront lingering misconceptions and cements
what we learned in our memories. It's also simply useful to refresh your memory
later!

For these reasons, we'll spend the rest of this lab creating a personal page,
and then learning to write a blog post about what we learned.

Github ([https://www.github.com](github.com)) is a web service for storing and
sharing code, along with a huge number of services surrounding that code. It
uses a tool and protocol called `git` [https://git-scm.com/](git) to store and
retrieve that code. Github Pages
[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/) is one of the services
Github provides for publishing personal and project websites from your Github
account.

This lab is a basic introduction to all of these. We will learn to use them in
more detail as the quarter goes on; learning all that git, Github, or Github
Pages has to offer could take months of practice!

### Part 7 – Creating a Website with Github Pages

Below is a link to a video you can reference for help creating a Github pages site.
[CSE 15L Week 0: Github Pages Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZqizez1Dzs&ab_channel=SamWong)

[![Github Pages Video](https://i3.ytimg.com/vi/GZqizez1Dzs/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZqizez1Dzs&ab_channel=SamWong)

#### Make a Github Account

Go to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com) and create an account:

![](/images/github-signup.png)

(If you already have an account, you choose if you want to use it or create a
new one for this course).

You can choose any username you like for the account; it doesn't have to be
related to your legal or preferred name, though it can be and often is. Some
people choose names related to their name, like me (my Github account is
[jpolitz](https://github.com/jpolitz)). Others choose more abstract or whimsical
names for their accounts, just like usernames on any other service. Feel free to
do whatever feels right to you, and in any event, you can always [change it
later](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings/changing-your-github-username).


#### Create a Repository

Once you've created your account, we are going to _create a new repository_ on
Github. A _repository_ is a folder or directory with an associated history of
changes that were made to the files within it. In this sense, a repository on
Github has some similarities to a folder in Google Drive; the differences are
mainly in the level of control we get in managing that history of changes.

![](/images/new-repository.png)

Name the repository `cse15l-lab-reports` (in my screenshot it looks like the
name is taken because I made it before taking the screenshot; it will be green
and OK for you). Leave the other settings as they are, and click "Create
Repository" at the bottom.

![](/images/create-repository.png)

You should see a screen like this (but with your username):

![](/images/new-repository-screen.png)

Click the "Create a new file" link (small, in blue, beneath the "Set up in
Desktop" button). Make a new file called `index.md`, and put some text in it
(whatever you like).

![](/images/hello-world-pages.png)

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Commit new file". You should see
a view of your repository that now lists a file called `index.md`.

You have a public Github repository with some text in it! You can copy the link from your browser and send it to your friends and family to view!

#### Making a Pages Site

Next, click on "Settings" at the top of your repository, and then choose the
"Pages" option in the sidebar:

![](/images/settings-repo-button.png)

![](/images/github-pages-branch.png)

Choose `main` as the source for Github Pages, and click "Save".

![](/images/github-pages-link.png)


At the top it'll say “GitHub Pages source saved". Wait a bit and refresh the
page. Eventually you'll see a message that says “Your site is live at `<url
here>`.” (This can take a few minutes!) Click the link that's shown there; at
first it will say the page isn't found. Wait a few minutes, then refresh the
page.  Then you should see the text you wrote show up on a page like this:

![](/images/hello-world-page-load.png)

<!-- **Write down in notes** – everyone should be able to screenshot their page
showing the text they wrote in their `index.md`.

**Write down in notes** – Conduct the following experiment: -->

Note that in addition to seeing your file at, e.g,
[https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/](https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/),
you can also see it with `index.html` added to the end of the URL:
[https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/index.html](https://jpolitz.github.io/cse-15l-lab-report/index.html)
(Try it!).  Add another file to your repository with any name you choose, but
end it in the extension `.md`. Can you use this idea to see that file?

<!-- Write down what you think is happening when you commit a new file. -->

#### Editing Markdown

The `.md` extension stands for "Markdown," which is a particular text format
used for writing. There are many good documents on the web. A good cheat sheet
and explainer are here:

- [Cheat sheet](https://commonmark.org/help/)
- [What is Markdown?](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)

Skim both of those documents, then try to use some of the elements described in
the cheat sheet in your `index.md` file. How do some of the different formatting
options show up when you use them? Are any surprising?

<!-- **Write down in notes** – Try all of the formatting in the “Basic Syntax” part
of the markdown cheat sheet above; everyone should screenshot their page that
uses all of these. -->

You should now have:

- A repository with at least two files (`index.md` and another one you made up)
- In one of those files, a use of each kind of basic Markdown syntax
- A page that shows the rendered version of your Markdown text at a public URL

**Congratulations** – you now know how to make a (simple), public-facing website
with basic formatting! You can share the link to your page with anyone in the
world with an internet connection, and they can see your page.

(Fun fact: [the page you are
reading](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-w22/ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/blob/main/_posts/weeks/2022-01-10-week2.md)
is written in Markdown and uses Github Pages!)
