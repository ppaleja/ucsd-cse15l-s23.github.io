## Skill Demonstration 1

This week is Skill Demonstration 1. Lab time will be replaced with attending skill demos at each student's alloted time for the examination. Head to EdStem for instructions regarding logistics and assigned tasks. You can (and should) practice these tasks ahead of time.

Also note that we will be moving/cancelling office hours *after* the first skill demo on Wednesday is hosted.

## Lab Report 3 {#week5-lab-report}

You’ll write this report as a Github Pages page, then print that page to PDF and upload to Gradescope.

### Researching Commands

Consider the commands `less`, `find`, and `grep`. Choose _one_ of them. Online,
find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command
you chose. For example, we saw the `-name` option for `find` in class. For each
of those options, give 2 examples of using it on files and directories from
`./written_2`. Show each example as a code block that shows the command and its
output, and write a sentence or two about what it’s doing and why it’s
useful.

That makes 8 total examples, all focused on a single command. There should be
two examples each for four different command-line options. Many commands like
these have pretty sophisticated behavior possible – it can take years to be
exposed to and learn all of the possible tricks and inner workings.

Along with each option/mode you show, cite your source for how you found out
about it as a URL or a description of where you found it.

To find information about the commands, a simple Web search like “find
command-line options” will probably give decent results. There is also a
built-in command on many systems called `man` (short for “manual”) that
displays information about commands; you can use `man grep`, for example, to
see a long listing of information about how `grep` works. Also consider asking
ChatGPT!
