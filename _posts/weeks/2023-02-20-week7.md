## Lab Tasks

# CLDQ – CSE Labs "Done Quick"

## Introduction
---
There are many things we can do to speed up working with the command line, making it more efficient and easy to use. In this lab, you’re going to learn how to customize your settings to make your life as easy as possible. Then, you will compete in small teams against your peers to see who can accomplish the given command line tasks most efficiently - and maybe pick up some winners’ tricks along the way.

## Challenge Tasks
---
These are the tasks you will be timing yourself on. As setup, Make a fork of <insert repo here> on your Github account, so it starts as an exact copy of our repository. Before timing yourself again, make sure to delete and re-fork the repository so you’re starting from a clean state.

1. Log into ieng6
2. Fork and then clone the repository from your Github account
3. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
4. Edit the code file to fix the failing test
5. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
6. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

## xBaseline
---
Before you potentially race against others, you are going to see how much you can improve your own time. So, before you make any changes, take a baseline measurement of performing the tasks above by timing yourself (on your phone, or in a browser). 

**Write down in notes:** What was your baseline time? Did your lab partner have a faster baseline than you? If so, do they have any tips to help you get started on boosting your efficiency?

## Speed Up
---
Now, you will explore various ways that you can speed up your work. Try all the steps below, and find out what works best (and what doesn’t work) for you!

### Generating SSH Keys for ieng6
---
- In your local terminal, run `ssh-keygen`
- Keep entering `<Enter>` until you see your key's randomart image.
  - Note the path where the public key is saved (underlined below). 
  - ![Image](../../images/ssh_keygen.png)
- Now, log into your remote course specific account
- Type `mkdir .ssh` to the terminal
- Logout of your remote account
- Now, we want to copy the public SSH key you created onto your remote account, specifically inside the `.ssh` directory you just created.
- Scroll up a bit to where you were creating the SSH key, find the line where it says: `Your public key has been saved in: <path to your public SSH key>`, copy the path.
- Next, type `scp <path to your public SSH key> cs15lwi23__@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
  - Enter password when prompted
- Try log onto your remote account again, you shouldn’t be prompted for a password anymore

### Generating SSH Keys for GitHub
---
You can access and write data in repositories on GitHub.com using SSH. When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine, which in our case will be the ieng6 machine. 

Create a private SSH key file in ieng6:
- Login to ieng6 using your account credentials
- Run the command: `$ ssh-keygen`
- When asked to save the key, press ‘Enter’ to save to - the default location.
- When prompted for a paraphrase, press ‘Enter’ to save - without a password.

Adding a new SSH key to your account:
- Copy the SSH public key generated above to your clipboard using cat like below:
  - `$ cat <path of your ssh key .pub file>`
- Open your github account on the browser.
- In the upper right corner, click on your profile photo, then click **Settings**.
- In the “Access” section of the sidebar, click **SSH and GPG keys**.
- Click **New SSH key** or **Add SSH key** under the “SSH keys” section.
- Add a “Title” to your key (ex: <Your Name>’s ieng6 machine).
- Select the “Key Type” to be an Authentication Key
- Copy your public key from the output of the cat command and paste it into the “Key” field
- Click **Add SSH key**.
- If prompted, confirm access to your account on Github.

Go back to the ieng6 terminal and:	
- Run the following command to add Github.com as a recognized host: 
  - `$ ssh-keyscan -t rsa github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts`
- Check your connection by running the following command: 
  - `$ ssh -T git@github.com`

Now we have an SSH key which can be used to authenticate to GitHub! Clone the repository for this lab ***using the command line*** with the following command: 
  - `$ git clone git@github.com:ucsd-cse15l-w23/lab7.git `
    - You might notice the URL we used to clone looks different from the ones we've used so far! This is because since we have set up an SSH key, we need to use the URL specified for SSH rather than HTTPS! (Make sure the SSH tab is checked as seen below.)
    - ![Image](../../images/clone_with_ssh.png)

If the SSH key setup was completed correctly, the repository should now clone successfully!

### Git Configuration
---
### Auto Completion

1. Using Bash History (up/down arrows)
    - You can use the “up” and “down” arrows to go through the history of commands you have executed, it makes executing the same command much easier!

2. Using Tab
    - You can use the Tab key to speed up typing commands in the command line in the following ways:
      - Start typing the first few letters of a command (or part of a command, like a file name). Pressing tab once will autofill the rest of the line up to the point where there are multiple potential possibilities. If you press tab a second time, it will show you all of the possibilities for what it could autocomplete to. 

3. Keyboard Shortcuts
    - More details at: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/shortcuts-command-line-navigation
    - Have you had a time where you mistyped one of the commands and had to backspace all the way back to fix the problem? There’s a better way!
      - Ctrl-U deletes everything from the current cursor position to the beginning of the line
      - Ctrl-K deletes everything from the current cursor position to the end of the line
      - Ctrl-A goes back to the beginning of the line
      - Ctrl-E goes to the end of the line
      - Ctrl-W deletes the last word
      - Alt-Left/Alt-Right (Windows) or Option-Left/Option-Right (Mac) to move by word
      - Click the “left” or “right” arrow to go to the left/right end of any selection!

4. Quick Copy/Paste
    - Use these keyboard shortcuts to highlight text quicker:
      - Double click – selects an entire word
      - Triple click - selects an entire paragraph
      - `Alt+Shift-Left/Alt+Shift-Right` (Windows) or `Option+Shift-Left/Option+Shift-Right` (Mac) -  select multiple words

    - On Mac: 
      - `Ctrl-C` to copy
      - `Ctrl-V` to paste

    - On Windows: 
      - `Ctrl-C` to copy
      - `Ctrl-V` to paste
      - Right click to paste in Windows terminal

## New PR!
--- 
Now that you’re all set with your preferences, time yourself again doing the same tasks.

**Write down in notes:** How much were you able to improve from your baseline?

## The Tournament
---
Now, it’s time to race your peers in small groups! By the end of lab, only one lab group will come out on top.

![Image](../../images/tournament_hierarchy.jpg)

### Find Your Group's Champion
---
*Within* your group, anyone who wants to be a contestant in the CLDQ championship should have an initial race.

Have someone start a timer and say “go” (make sure you have a fresh fork, etc, before starting!)

Whoever goes fastest in your group will be the representative of your group in the Aisle stage.

There are 20 total minutes for this stage. After you select the representative, the *whole group* should work together to think of ways to speed up their process. All members should help the representative to prepare for the competition. Look at their preferences, and make any suggestions that you think could speed them up even more (make sure to have them try, first). 

**Write down in notes:** Who was the representative of your team to compete in the first round? Did you make any last minute changes to their settings before the race?

### Aisle Round
---
Your tutor will give you the signal to start the clock! Race against the lab group next to you, or if your group has a bye, go watch another race and see if you can pick up anything your team could use in the next round.

Then, after you have the winner, the *whole aisle* should work together to suggest improvements for the final round

### Final Race
---
Once again, you have **10 minutes** to make your choice for your representative to compete in the final race, and make any final adjustments to your strategy.

Then, wait for the tutor to start the clock!

### Reflect
---
What’s something you learned from one of the contestants outside of your group?
